# Notes:
#   - if you have some state variable <STATE_VAR>, then you must have 3 equations specific to it in this format:
#     - in the 'synapse' group, `d<STATE_VAR> = ...`
#     - in the 'synapse' group, `<STATE_VAR>_total_post = ...`
#     - in the 'target_neuron' group, `<STATE_VAR>_total = ...`
